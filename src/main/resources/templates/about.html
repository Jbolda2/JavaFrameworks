    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div>
        Gentlemen's Shoewear makes shoes by gentlemen, for gentlemen. This company was founded in 1806 by
        John R. Gentlemen, to ensure proper footwear is available to those who need it. That's why John worked day and
        night on his craft, ensuring that his fellow gentlemen have the support that they need to thrive. Along the way,
        John R. Gentlemen discovered the perfect five shoes to fit any occasion. We take pride in our selection, and we
        want to be who you call when you need a little support in your life.
